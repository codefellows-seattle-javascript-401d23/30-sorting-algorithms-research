# Lab 30 - Sorting Algorithms Research

## Overview

This lab project involved researching and coding some basic sorting algorithms, including: 

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort

## Description

### Bubble Sort

The bubble sort method takes an array with an arity of 1. The method loops through the array and checks each value to the value next to it, swapping them if the second is bigger (for ascending order). It continues to loop through checking each value until it has gone through a full loop without needing to swap. 

### Insertion Sort

The insertion sort method takes an array with an arity of 1. The method starts with a 'sorted list' of length 1, the first element. Each element after that we place into our 'sorted list' which grows by 1 element each time we place an element in it. 

### Selection Sort

The selection sort method takes an array with an arity of 1. This method repeatedly finds the smallest element left in the unsorted array and moves it to the beginning before moving on to the next element and finding the smallest element in the remaining unsorted portion of the array.
