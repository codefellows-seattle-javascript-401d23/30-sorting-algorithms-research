# Lab 30 - Sorting Algorithms Research

## Overview

This lab project involved researching and coding some basic sorting algorithms, including: 

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort

## Description

### Bubble Sort

The bubble sort method loops through the array and checks each value to the value next to it, swapping them if the second is bigger (for ascending order). It continues to loop through checking each value until it has gone through a full loop without needing to swap. 

### Insertion Sort

The insertion sort method
