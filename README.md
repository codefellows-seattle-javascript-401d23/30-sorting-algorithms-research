__Bubble Sort:__
In your README.md describe the exported values of each module you have defined. Every function description should include it's airty (expected number of paramiters), the expected data for each paramiter (data-type and limitations), and it's behavior (for both valid and invalued use). 
__Insertion Sort__
__Selection Sort__

## Architecture
Each function takes an integer array as a single argument and sorts it in-place (e.g. mutates the array).
