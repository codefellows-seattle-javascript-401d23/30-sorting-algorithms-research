### Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through an array of items, compares each pair of adjacent items
and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 

The Bubble Sort algorithm takes an array with an arity of 1.

### Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is super ineffecient on large arrays. 

The insertion sort algorithm takes an array with an arity of 1.

### Selection Sort
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part (on the right) and putting it at the beginning (left).

The selection sort algorithm takes an array with an arity of 1.
