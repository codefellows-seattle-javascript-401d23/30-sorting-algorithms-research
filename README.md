Lab 30: Basic Sorting
===

**Author:** Jennifer Piper

This is a demonstration of sorting algorithms using JavaScript.

## Modules

There are three modules with the same arity, inputs, and outputs:

```bubbleSort```

```insertionSort```

```selectionSort```

Each module is arity(1). It takes in an array of integers and returns the array sorted in-place from smallest to largest.

Most invalid inputs return the input unaltered. An input array containing mixed integers and other types returns an array that may have some elements reordered in a non-useful way. Future addition of error-checking should throw an error when invalid input is received.

## Testing

To run tests:

```npm i```

```npm run test```
