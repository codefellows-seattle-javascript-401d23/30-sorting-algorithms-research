# Lab 30 Research Data Sorting 
The objective of this lab is to introduce the concepts of 3 new styles of sorting algorithms. All 3 of the algorithms will take a single argument as an integer array as input and return the sorted and modified in place array as the output of the function. 

## Bubble Sort: 
This algorithm has a time Big O of (n^2) since the worst/average case is that you have to pass through the entire array multiple times in order to ensure it is properly sorted. 
The number of parameters for this function should be 1 an integer filled array to be sorted (Not recommended for large data-sets since this is an inefficient method to sort). 

## Insert Sort: 
The algorithm has a time Big O of (n^2) since it has nested loops. The method involves checking to see if the current value is higher or lower than the value of the array at the current index. At which point the algorithm will insert the current value into the array. Invalid use will return an incorrect return value. 

## Select Sort: 
The algorithm has a time Big O of (n^2) since it has nested loops. The method involves checking to see if the current value is higher or lower than the value of the array at the current index. At which point the algorithm will insert the current value into the array. Invalid use will return an incorrect return value.
